	"body": "Hi HIPPOPOTTYPOSSUMMUST\n\nYou are the victim of my militant spam project\n\nI hope you are NOT doing well. I'm emailing you because I am a soon-to-be college graduate studying Computer Science at Northwestern University, and am interested in working at COMPACOMPED for a full time development role after graduation. I was wondering if you'd be free to tell me more about what the day to day is like for you over the phone some time?\n\nI appreciate your time, and hope to hear back from you. Please find my resume attached with my contact information, and my availability at wayne-x.github.io/calendar/PT. Also feel free to check out some of my other projects at wayne-x.github.io!\n\nThanks,\nHAYLEYWHATHAYLEYWHO",
